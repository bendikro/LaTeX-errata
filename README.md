# Errata.sty: Error markup for LaTeX documents

 This package provides a simple infrastructure for recording errata in LaTeX
 documents. This allows to maintain an updated version of the document (with all errors
 corrected) and automatically generate an errata document highlighting the difference to
 the published version.
